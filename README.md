# Objective Flashcards

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for Objective Flashcards! This is a beginner project for me to recap what I know about Swift from [years back](https://swiftin.sg) and to also pick up Objective-C. This is nothing more than your basic flashcard memory app with basic features inside.

## Motivation

I'm currently interning at a company that requires me to possibly work on iOS app development. I might be a little rusty in that, so I'm developing this as a way to remember what I've learnt. On top of that, I might get the chance to dabble in some legacy code in Objective-C, and so I added the challenge of developing (as much of) this project in that language.

## Contributing

Since this is a project to self-learn things, I'm not looking for any contributors at this time. If you have any tips to leave in code though or ways to do things better, feel free to make a PR and add comments or explainers!
